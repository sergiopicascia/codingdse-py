# Data Manipulation with Pandas

## Introduction to Pandas

[**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) is an open-source Python library built on top of NumPy. It provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

**Why Pandas?**

*   **Tabular Data:** It is specifically designed to work with tabular (table-like) data, similar to a spreadsheet or a SQL table.
*   **Data Alignment:** Intelligent handling of data alignment means you don't have to worry about mismatched indexes when performing operations between datasets.
*   **Missing Data:** Provides a robust toolkit for handling missing data (`NaN`).
*   **Performance:** Core operations are written in C or Cython, making them extremely fast.
*   **Rich Functionality:** Offers a vast range of tools for data wrangling, grouping, merging, reshaping, and time-series analysis.

First, let's install it and set up our environment.

```shell
# In your terminal, with your virtual environment activated
pip install pandas
```

The conventional alias for pandas is `pd`.

```python
import pandas as pd
```

## Core Data Structures: `Series` and `DataFrame`

Pandas has two primary data structures.

#### `Series`
A `Series` is a one-dimensional labeled array, capable of holding any data type. It's like a single column in a spreadsheet.

```python
# Creating a Series from a list
genres = pd.Series(['Action', 'Comedy', 'Drama', 'Sci-Fi'])
print(genres)
```
**Output:**
```
0     Action
1     Comedy
2      Drama
3     Sci-Fi
dtype: object
```
Notice the two components: the **index** (0, 1, 2, 3) on the left and the **values** on the right.

#### `DataFrame`
A `DataFrame` is a two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types. It is the most commonly used pandas object and can be thought of as a spreadsheet, a SQL table, or a dictionary of `Series` objects.

```python
# Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary
data = {
    'title': ['Movie A', 'Movie B', 'Movie C'],
    'rating': [8.5, 7.9, 9.1],
    'year': [2017, 2018, 2017]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
print(df)
```
**Output:**
```
     title  rating  year
0  Movie A     8.5  2017
1  Movie B     7.9  2018
2  Movie C     9.1  2017
```

## Data Ingestion

For our case study, we will use a custom CSV file. Please create a file named `movies.csv` inside your `data/` directory with the following content:

```csv

```

Now, let's load this data into a DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`.

```python
# Load the dataset
file_path = 'data/movies.csv'
movies_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Before manipulating the data, we must first understand it. This is a critical first step in any data analysis project.

**`df.head(n)`**: View the first `n` rows of the DataFrame (default is 5).

```python
print(movies_df.head())
```

**`df.info()`**: Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame. This is arguably the most important inspection method. It shows the index dtype, column dtypes, non-null values, and memory usage.

```python
movies_df.info()
```
**Output Analysis:**
```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 12 entries, 0 to 11
Data columns (total 12 columns):
 #   Column            Non-Null Count  Dtype
---  ------            --------------  -----
 0   rank              12 non-null     int64
 1   title             12 non-null     object 
 2   genre             12 non-null     object
 3   description       12 non-null     object
 4   director          12 non-null     object
 5   actors            12 non-null     object
 6   year              12 non-null     int64
 7   runtime_minutes   12 non-null     int64
 8   rating            12 non-null     float64
 9   votes             12 non-null     int64
 10  revenue_millions  11 non-null     float64
 11  metascore         12 non-null     int64
dtypes: float64(2), int64(5), object(5)
memory usage: 1.3+ KB
```
From `.info()`, we immediately identify a potential issue: `revenue_millions` has only 11 non-null values out of 12 entries. This indicates one missing value.

**`df.describe()`**: Generates descriptive statistics for the numerical columns.

```python
print(movies_df.describe())
```
This gives us the count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartile values for each numerical column. It's a great way to get a feel for the distribution of the data.

**`df.shape`**: Returns a tuple representing the dimensionality (rows, columns).
```python
print(f"Dataset dimensions: {movies_df.shape}")
```

## Indexing

Pandas offers a rich set of methods for selecting subsets of your data.

#### Selecting a Single Column
This returns a `Series`.
```python
titles = movies_df['title']
print(titles.head())
```

#### Selecting Multiple Columns
Pass a list of column names. This returns a new `DataFrame`.
```python
subset = movies_df[['title', 'director', 'rating', 'revenue_millions']]
print(subset.head())
```

#### Row Selection: `.loc` and `.iloc`
*   **`.loc`** selects by **label** (index name, column name).
*   **`.iloc`** selects by **integer position**.

```python
# .loc: Select the row with index label 3
print(movies_df.loc[3])

# .iloc: Select the row at integer position 0 (the first row)
print(movies_df.iloc[0])

# Slicing with .loc (inclusive of the end label)
print(movies_df.loc[2:5]) # Rows with index 2, 3, 4, 5

# Slicing with .iloc (exclusive of the end position)
print(movies_df.iloc[2:5]) # Rows at position 2, 3, 4
```

#### Boolean Indexing

This is the most common and powerful way to filter data. We can pass a Series of `True`/`False` values to select rows that meet a certain condition.

**Find all movies released after 2015.**

```python
# 1. Create the boolean condition
condition = movies_df['year'] > 2015

# 2. Apply the condition to the DataFrame
recent_movies = movies_df[condition]
print(recent_movies[['title', 'year']])
```

**Find all 'Action' movies with a rating higher than 8.0.**
We can combine conditions using `&` (and) and `|` (or). Each condition must be wrapped in parentheses.

```python
high_rated_action = movies_df[
    (movies_df['genre'] == 'Action') & (movies_df['rating'] > 8.0)
]
print(high_rated_action[['title', 'genre', 'rating']])
```

## Data Cleaning

Real-world data is rarely clean. We already identified a missing value in the `revenue_millions` column.

#### Finding Missing Values
The `.isnull()` (or `.isna()`) method returns a boolean DataFrame. We can chain it with `.sum()` to get a count of `NaN`s per column.

```python
print(movies_df.isnull().sum())
```
This confirms one missing value in `revenue_millions`.

#### Handling Missing Values
There are two primary strategies:
1.  **Deletion:** Remove the rows or columns with missing data (`.dropna()`). This is viable if you have a large dataset and only a few missing values.
2.  **Imputation:** Fill the missing values with some other value (`.fillna()`). A common choice is the mean or median of the column.

Let's use imputation. We'll fill the missing revenue with the average revenue of all other movies.

```python
# Calculate the mean revenue
mean_revenue = movies_df['revenue_millions'].mean()
print(f"Mean revenue: {mean_revenue:.2f} million")

# Fill NaN values with the mean. `inplace=True` modifies the DataFrame directly.
movies_df['revenue_millions'].fillna(mean_revenue, inplace=True)

# Verify that the missing value is gone
print("\nAfter filling missing values:")
movies_df.info()
```

## Data Manipulation

#### Creating New Columns
We can create new columns based on calculations from existing ones. Let's create a `rating_per_million_votes` column to normalize the rating score.

```python
movies_df['rating_per_vote'] = movies_df['rating'] / (movies_df['votes'] / 1_000_000)
print(movies_df[['title', 'rating', 'votes', 'rating_per_vote']].head())
```

#### Applying Functions with `.apply()`
The `.apply()` method is extremely versatile. It can apply a function along an axis of the DataFrame. Let's create a column that categorizes a movie's rating.

```python
# 1. Define a function
def rate_category(rating):
    if rating >= 8.0:
        return 'Excellent'
    elif rating >= 7.0:
        return 'Good'
    else:
        return 'Average'

# 2. Apply the function to the 'rating' column
movies_df['rating_category'] = movies_df['rating'].apply(rate_category)

print(movies_df[['title', 'rating', 'rating_category']].head())
```

## Grouping and Aggregation (`groupby`)

The `groupby` operation follows a **Split-Apply-Combine** pattern:
1.  **Split:** The data is split into groups based on some criteria (e.g., by 'genre' or 'director').
2.  **Apply:** A function (e.g., `mean`, `sum`, `count`) is applied to each group independently.
3.  **Combine:** The results are combined into a new data structure.

**Which movie genres are the most profitable on average?**

```python
# Group by genre and calculate the mean of the revenue_millions for each group
genre_revenue = movies_df.groupby('genre')['revenue_millions'].mean()

# Sort the results to see the most profitable
sorted_genre_revenue = genre_revenue.sort_values(ascending=False)
print(sorted_genre_revenue)
```

**Who are the most consistently high-rated directors?**
We can group by 'director' and calculate multiple aggregate statistics at once using the `.agg()` method.

```python
director_analysis = movies_df.groupby('director').agg(
    movie_count=('title', 'count'),
    avg_rating=('rating', 'mean'),
    avg_revenue=('revenue_millions', 'mean')
).sort_values(by='avg_rating', ascending=False)

print(director_analysis)
```

## Basic Visualization

Pandas integrates with Matplotlib, allowing for quick and simple plotting directly from a DataFrame or Series.

**How have movie ratings evolved over the years?**
Let's plot the average rating per year.

```python
# For plotting, it's good practice to install matplotlib
# pip install matplotlib

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Group by year and calculate the mean rating
yearly_avg_rating = movies_df.groupby('year')['rating'].mean()

yearly_avg_rating.plot(
    kind='bar', # Type of plot
    title='Average Movie Rating by Year',
    xlabel='Year',
    ylabel='Average Rating'
)

# Display the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
